This is my Python cheatsheet to help me while i learn Python <br>




Functions Checklist:<br>
Did you start your function definition with def?<br>
Does your function name have only characters and _ (underscore) characters?<br>
Did you put an open parenthesis ( right after the function name?<br>
Did you put your arguments after the parenthesis ( separated by commas?<br>
Did you make each argument unique (meaning no duplicated names)?<br>
Did you put a close parenthesis and a colon ): after the arguments?<br>
Did you indent all lines of code you want in the function four spaces? No more, no less.<br>
Did you "end" your function by going back to writing with no indent (dedenting we call it)?<br>
<br>
<b> FUNCTIONS </b><br>
print - prints the string, variable, etc.<br>
raw_input() - takes input from a user, note that raw_input should be used over 'input' as the latter has security issues<br>
text.truncate() - function that erases all of the data within the file defined by the variable 'text' (i.e. requires text = open(filename))<br>
<br>
<b> MODULES </b><br>
(sys) argv - lets you define a number of command-line arguments to be passed to the script<br>
